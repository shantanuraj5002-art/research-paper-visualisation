## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

Check the backend terminal for errors. Common issues:

**"API key not valid"**
→ Double-check your Google API key in .env

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ Wait a minute, you're making too many requests

**"Model not found"**
→ Already fixed! Using gemini-pro now

**"Failed to fetch"**
→ Make sure both servers are running

## 💡 Tips

1. **First generation might be slower** - subsequent ones are faster
2. **Upload smaller PDFs first** - easier to test
3. **Check browser console (F12)** - for any frontend errors
4. **Check backend terminal** - for any API errors
